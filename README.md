# CHECKER TOOL

The proces of creating the 'checker tool'.


# CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT 

We reflect on the Dutch elections with our 'checker tool'. 
Our choices of political parties is strongly influenced by our feed on social media, the newspaper we read and the people we talk to. We simply read what comes to us. But there is more information within the feed we receive. There is a whole world unseen by us passive readers. 

# How to read media? 

To tackle this behavior we came up with the idea of the 'checker tool'. The checker tool gives you a bigger context of the feed you receive. It shows you what the pictures' original source is and, as a main focus, the cluster in wich it exist. Here you will see in what area of the web your information derives from. And to constrast this, you also see which part of the internet your source doesn't touch. 

# Seeing the unseen 

With the 'checker tool' you will get a better idea of the geography of your every day (news)feed. With an easy checker it is no trouble checking where you are at. Your behavior is of course something you don't dive into actively. But this tool makes you curious to know more. And once installed, super easy and functional to use.

Scan the internet world you're in and find out that there is more. Go see the unseen!
